WHMCS registrar module for domreg.lt 
============

### About

This is the WHMCS domain registrar module which handles .LT domains (lithuanian TLD). It's mainly based on the EPP protocol, with some slight modifications. The registrar for which this module is dedicated, is [www.domreg.lt](http://www.domreg.lt)

### Status

As of date (2014-02-20), the module is still in some development, but major functions are already implemented and tested:
* Domain registration
* Registrant info maintenance
* Nameserver management
* ...

### Community

The Domreg module is shared openly with the community because of the demand for modules that support custom EPP implementations. However, this module currently supports only domreg.lt registrar and it's fitted to our business requirements. 

We hope this module receives contribution from you, guys, since more contribution == better support for everyone. Fork, star, use it and share it :3

### Development Roadmap

* Domain transfers
* Separate business logic from the integration layer
* Write a lot of unit tests


### Provider

This module is provided and supported by HappyHosting.lt.
